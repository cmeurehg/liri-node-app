The application allows the user to obtain tweets from Twitter, information about songs from Spotify and information about
movies from Omdb.  The application can also be accessed through the link in my portfolio:

The Tweet command allows to retrieve tweets from any username entered.  If no username is entered, then it provides a default username.

The commands required are:

'my-tweets' [tweeter handle - or a default account will be used]
'movie-this' [name of a movie - in quotation marks if the title has several words]
'spotify-this-song' [name of a song - in quotation marks if the title has several words]
